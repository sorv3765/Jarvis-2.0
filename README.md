# Jarvis-2.0
created my own Virtual Assistant J.A.R.V.I.S.

Will need to create an .env file specifically for putting your own API Keys for some of the Online apps to work. Replace all the "none" with your API Keys.

USER=None
BOTNAME=JARVIS
EMAIL=None
PASSWORD=None
NEWS_API_KEY=None
OPENWEATHER_APP_ID=None
TMDB_API_KEY=None

make sure you have pip installed all these modules
pywhatkit
requests
wikipedia
pyttsx3
SpeechRecognition
decouple              #pip install python-decouple

if there's an issue with 'couldn't find pyaudio check if its installed', I did my homework for you.

pip install pipwin
pipwin install pyaudio
